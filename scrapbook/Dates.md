## Third

03/14/2023

### Event -- Skate Zone 71

4900 Evanswood Dr, Columbus, OH 43229

Dickhead, you forgot your fucking wallet 🤪 They paid for everything. Went
around the rink 4 times, music too loud couldn't hear them, but got to hold
hands 👫 It felt very natural and I wanted to hold them more.

---

After Food went back to my place. They got to judge me on how I live and was OK
with it (even the dead bodies in the closet☠️).

### Movie --  Kiki's Delivery Service

... But much more cuddling was done!!!! 😍😍😍😍 God, it was fucking awesome.
They seemed very comfortable with me touching them and shed some tears of joy.
It was very touching.

### Food -- Northstar Cafe

951 N High St, Columbus, OH 43201

We -- Smoothie Bowl and Northstar Burger

The smoothie bowl really was a smoothie in a bowl 😂 (Is this high class or is
that just fucking weird???)
The burger was damn good, but the best part was holding and hugging them the
entire time.

Don't worry we paid them back 😉

## Fourth

03/18/2023

Sicker than a dog, feeling very achy, didn't stop me from getting on with it. We
both wore masks and I just cleaned the shit out of myself before going out for
the night. I suspect the sickness may have come from them 🤨 Started with dinner
because the event started at 7:30pm

### Food -- Northstar Cafe

951 N High St, Columbus, OH 43201

I -- Northstar Burger
They -- Chicken & Avocado Sandwich

I showed my true wolf 🐺 and ate the entire dish in 3 minutes flat. They
supposedly came in "boy form", but they still looked feminine to me. They
figured out that I wouldn't give a fuck if we were perceived as a gay couple.

### Event -- Painting Class

691 North High Street, Columbus, OH 43215

More like a speed painting class. Made a rainbow moon, wasn't really feeling
mine, theirs came out well though. Didn't get much time to talk as it was step
after step after step, though it was an enjoyable process, we agreed.

### Movie -- The Proposal

Couldn't love on them as much as last time with the face masks, but got to kiss
their back. They did the absolute most adorable thing when I had them pinned and
ready to tickle. They pleaded "I surrender 🥺" Ahhhhhh 🥵 I wanted to do things
to them in that moment, dirty, dirty things.

They told me they've been seeing someone for the past six months and have
feelings for them. How the fuck is this supposed to make me feel? Why the fuck
were they on Hinge if this is true? So unsure... 😞
